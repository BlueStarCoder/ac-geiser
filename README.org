#+TITLE: ac-geiser
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil ^:nil

* Introduction

This project is inspired by [[https://github.com/purcell/ac-slime][ac-slime]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-nrepl][ac-nrepl]], which makes Scheme
programming in Emacs more enjoyable by providing a completion source for the
popular Emacs interactive auto-completion framework [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/][auto-complete]].

Where [[http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/][geiser]] provides it, pop-up documentation for completed symbols will be
displayed.

* Installation

First, ensure =auto-complete= and =geiser= are installed.

You'll need both =auto-complete= and =geiser= to be enabled and working, so
please consult the corresponding documentation if you have any trouble with
this.

Next, install =ac-geiser=. Here is one possible way:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:xiaohanyu/ac-geiser.git
#+END_SRC

Then put necessary code to your =.emacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name
                           "/your/path/to/ac-geiser"))
  (require 'ac-geiser)
  (add-hook 'geiser-mode-hook 'ac-geiser-setup)
  (add-hook 'geiser-repl-mode-hook 'ac-geiser-setup)
  (eval-after-load "auto-complete"
    '(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'geiser-repl-mode))
#+END_SRC

If you use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]], you can install =ac-geiser= in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq el-get-sources
        '((:name ac-geiser
                 :description "Emacs auto-complete backend for geiser"
                 :type github
                 :pkgname "xiaohanyu/ac-geiser"
                 :depends (auto-complete geiser)
                 :features ac-geiser
                 :after (progn
                          (ome-ac-geiser-setup)))))

  (el-get 'sync (mapcar 'el-get-source-name el-get-sources))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

=ac-geiser= should now automatically be enabled when you visit a buffer in
which =geiser-mode= is active and =auto-complete= is enabled.

Simply trigger auto-completion, and completion candidates supplied by geiser
should be displayed, with the symbol =g= on the right hand side of the
completion pop-up. After a short delay, popup documentation for the completed
symbol should also be displayed.
